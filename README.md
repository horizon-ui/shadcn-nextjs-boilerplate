### Introduction

Horizon AI Boilerplate is the first open source OpenAI ChatGPT AI Template made for Shadcn UI, NextJS and Tailwind CSS! Start creating outstanding Chat AI SaaS Apps faster.

It comes with over 30+ dark/light frontend individual elements, like buttons, inputs, navbars, nav tabs, cards, or alerts, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining.

### Documentation

Each element is well presented in a very complex documentation. You can read more about the <a href="https://horizon-ui.com/docs-boilerplate/shadcn-components/chat" target="_blank">documentation here.</a>

### Quick Start

Install Horizon ChatGPT AI Template by running either of the following:

- Install NodeJS LTS from [NodeJs Official Page](https://nodejs.org/en/?ref=horizon-documentation) (NOTE: Product only works with LTS version)

<br />

Clone the repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/horizon-ui/shadcn-nextjs-boilerplate.git
```

Run in the terminal this command:

```
npm install
```

<br />

```
npm run init
```

<br />

Then run this command to start your local server:

```
npm run dev
```
&nbsp;

### Your API Key is not working?

- Make sure you have an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/account) and a valid API key to use ChatGPT. We don't sell API keys.
- Make sure you have your billing info added in [OpenAI Billing page](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview). Without billing info, your API key will not work.
- The app will connect to the OpenAI API server to check if your API Key is working properly.
